            Special-song-search is a web application that allows you to search
            for new songs fitting all of your requirments.

            Rather than using a machine learning model which needs to collect
            your data to make some acceptable recommendations, Special Song
            Search provides several options and relies on you to specify what
            is most important to you. This means:
            1. It doesn't have to store your data.
            2. It can quickly alter its recommendations.
            3. If you like the results, it won't keep re-recommending the same
               small set of songs as some other recommendation engines do.

            fraction of the count of the tag on the diagonal for the tag-pair's
            row. The bright left-most column indicates that recordings tagged
            with any other variation of rock are also likely tagged with rock
            itself. For anyone who likes other forms of rock, but not
            alternative rock, they should rest assured that even though it is
            the most common subset of rock in this dataset, it still only
            accounts for a fifth of all rock and they can search for another
            subgenre with little overlap. Anyone wanting to slowly explore new
            genres or subgenres can choose their favorite tag and search for
            new tags with which it often appears together. data_analysis.ipynb
